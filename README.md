This repo contains the setup of [my Shiny server](http://45.55.32.181/shiny).  It is a git repo under `/srv/shiny-server` on my server.

To learn how you can get your own Shiny Server in a similar way, [read Dean's tutorial about how to set up Shiny Server](http://deanattali.com/2015/05/09/setup-rstudio-shiny-server-digital-ocean/). It's awesome!

Shiny servers can host shiny apps and R markdown documents.
